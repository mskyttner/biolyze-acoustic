Make sure to turn off dhclient before changing to a static ip:

As already mentioned, it is usually because dhclient is still running. I have had many a student get stuck in this loop by booting their machine with dhcp (thus dhclient starts) and then try to change the /etc/resolv.conf file. As also mentioned, dhclient rewrites this file at lease half-life when it renews. After my students realize what is happening, they change their /etc/network/interfaces file to use static information and restart networking. HOWEVER, when they restart the network, dhclient still isn't killed, because the init script sees that it is using a static address and doesn't know it needs to shutdown dhclient. If you were trying both dhcp and static settings, this could have been your problem. 

 The proper way to change from dhcp to static, is to shutdown networking with "/etc/inti.d/networking stop" (or "ifdown eth0"), make your changes in /etc/network/interfaces from dhcp to static, and then bring back up the network with "/etc/init.d/networking start" (or "ifup eth0"). And it sure doesn't hurt to do a "ps aux | grep dhclient" before you make the change to make sure dhclient is really dead.
